## Documentation

This project was created using Asp.net, and we may use it to confirm a potential or present employee's identification, education, job history, criminal background, and other pertinent information. In order to deliver accurate and trustworthy information, the system also integrates with outside verification organisations and data sources. The approach attempts to lower the possibility of recruiting dishonest or unqualified applicants, assure adherence to legal and regulatory standards, and improve the organization's credibility and reputation.
